  body: `Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing, and letter-spacing, and adjusting the space between pairs of letters.

Modern web typography has evolved significantly with the introduction of web fonts, variable fonts, and advanced CSS capabilities. Designers now have unprecedented control over how text appears across different devices and screen sizes.

The choice of typography can dramatically affect the user experience, readability, and overall aesthetic of a digital product. Good typography establishes visual hierarchy, guides the reader's eye, and creates an emotional connection with the content.

When selecting fonts for a project, consider factors such as readability at different sizes, character set support, loading performance, and how well the fonts work together as a system. The best typography often goes unnoticed by users because it simply works.`,
